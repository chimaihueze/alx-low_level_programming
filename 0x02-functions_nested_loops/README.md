C - Functions, nested loops

In this project, I learned about nested loops, header files, and variable scope in C while practicing declaring and defining my own functions.

Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

_putchar
0-holberton.c: C program that prints Holberton, followed by a new line. Returns 0.

I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
1-alphabet.c: C function that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

10 x alphabet
2-print_alphabet_x10.c: C function that prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times, followed by a new line.

islower
3-islower.c: C function that checks for lowercase characters. Returns 1 if the character is lowercase, 0 otherwise.

isalpha
4-isalpha.c: C function that checks for alphabetic characters. Returns 1 if the character is a letter, 0 otherwise.

Sign
5-sign.c: C function that prints the sign of a number. Returns:

1 and prints + if the number is greater than zero.

0 and prints 0 if the number is zero.

-1 and prints - if the number is less than zero.

There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
6-abs.c: C function that returns the absolute value of an integer.

There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
7-print_last_digit.c: C function that prints the last digit of a number. Returns the value of the last digit.

I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
8-24_hours.c: C function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

Learn your times table
9-times_table.c: C function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

a + b
10-add.c: C function that returns the addition of two integers.

Holberton School, 98 Battery Street, San Francisco CA 94111
11-print_to_98.c: C function that prints all natural numbers from an input to 98 followed by a new line, as follows:

Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.

Numbers are printed in order.

Input represents the number to begin counting from.

98 is the last number printed.

The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself
100-times_table.c: C function that prints the times table of an input value, starting with 0:

If input is greater than 15 or less than 0, function prints nothing.

Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women
101-natural.c: C program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded).

In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A
102-fibonacci.c: C program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line. Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.

Even Liber Abbaci
103-fibonacci.c: C program that prints the sum of even-valued Fibonacci numbers not exceeding 4,000,000, followed by a new line.

In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+
104-fibonacci.c: C program that prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line, without using long long, malloc, pointers, arrays, structures, or any library besides the standard. Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.
